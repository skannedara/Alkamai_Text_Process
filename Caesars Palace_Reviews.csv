Not that impressed with the room but the restaurants and the casino were nice. In my opinion it has a very convenient location in the middle of the strip.  Caesars Palace,2 day ago,TripAdvisor,Eliduer," “Lujo total” Quede fascinada con el hotel y la ciudad en general. El hotel está perfectamente ubicado, el casino es precioso hasta para aquellas personas a las que no les interesa el juego. Buen servicio de desayuno y excelente atención en general."  Caesars Palace,2 day ago,TripAdvisor,Lasvegasfuns," “Casinofunsjj” Clean, safe & lots of fun activities to do within the property. Comfortable bed. Hand held electronic indicator that your dining table is ready would greatly be appreciated to avoid the very long standing/waiting time to get in Bacchanal Buffet. Would prefer to use the waiting time to shop or gamble."  Caesars Palace,2 day ago,TripAdvisor,bilios76, “Inhospitable Service” No housekeeping services and very unfriendly staff. Poor quality of gaming options. No affordable dining options. So much construction it was hard to get around. Casino is disjointed and hard to navigate.  Caesars Palace,2 day ago,TripAdvisor,Ivyoimei P," “Excellent Trip to Las Vegas” Excellent host, she helped me to booked my reservation without any problem. She explained to me when I have questions and no comments at all. When I called her when she's not available, she will called me back on the same day or less than an hour to reach me back"  Caesars Palace,2 day ago,TripAdvisor,Carole-Coventry," “Lived up to Expectations” Awesome, huge, amazing, magical. So special!We stayed in the Roman Tower and were really pleased with the room, not sure why others are negative about these rooms?Professional check in, clear directions to the room (although you can easily get lost in this huge place)The beds are not beds they're nests! Clouds of softness and all encompassing nests of white linen and cotton....soooo comfortable.This hotel is so enormous we never entered or left by the same entrance twice!Forum shops are stunning but only if you have a figure like a stick insect and a bottomless bank account! If you're a size 8 or above with a modest income...forget it... unless you hit it big on the tables or pick up a sugar daddy?"  Caesars Palace,2 day ago,Yelp,Edna G,"The place has upgraded over the years...prices of their rooms have gone up extremely but there are tons of eating places to go to here as well as shopping. I usually wait for deals to stay here. It's in the center of the Vegas strip and walking distance to all other hotels and restaurants is a plus. It's upscale and classy. I love the forum shops as they have some of my favorite stores. Bathrooms are kept clean, the slot machines are my thing but my hubby goes for poker tables. He says they all start high usually. There is always entertainment outside especially by the bar and entrances. Everyone should come here..."  Caesars Palace,2 day ago,Yelp,Michelle R,"When you come to Vegas, there are certain Hotel/ Casinos you think of.  Caesars Palace is still the grandaddy of the Strip, and while its a bit old, it still draws the crowds.They've built newer towers, but the best location to stay is the Augustus tower, located right by the lobby.  The other towers are located miles away, and frankly its just too far.They have everything you can ask for.. .the casino, shows, restaurants with celebrity chefs (ie: Flay, Ramsay), and a huge shopping area which has high end stores like LV to affordable stores like Victoria Secret.  Its still one of my favorite Vegas locations, and its even better when I get comp'd."  Caesars Palace,12/7/14,Google,Ben Cain,Had a great time!  Caesars Palace,12/7/14,Google,Rodney S,"Lifestyles of the (not) Rich & Shameless. You know life is good when you're wading in the Temple pool, water falling down from the fountain above, massaging your head & shoulders, cooling off from the dry Las Vegas heat. My stay was at the new Octavius Tower, which recently opened at the beginning of the year. The Augustus & Octavius Towers have a separate entrance & lobby, which successfully segregates VIP' s like me (LOL) from the plebs staying at the more economical Palace Tower. Early check-in was a breeze, and I was soon on my way to room 6278. Room - OMFG! This is nice! 2 queen beds with 4 pillows & a bolster greeted us as we walked in. A large, flat-screen TV w/ media hub, a Keurig coffeemaker, well appointed minibar & couch were available to peruse at our leisure. The carpeting was nice & soft, and the room window had a pretty decent view of the Bellagio fountains next door. The bathroom was spectacular! There were dual sinks w/ another flatscreen TV, a whirlpool bath and a separate shower w/ a rainfall showerhead & glass door. I drew a couple hot baths during my stay and enjoyed soaking my old man body, with the jets seemingly making all my worries go away. The complimentary bath products were Gilchrist & Soames Qua Bath & Spa. It could be the just the fancy packaging, but they seemed luxuriant. Pool - The Temple Pool is gorgeous. Forget going in the afternoon, because it's literally shoulder-to-shoulder. All someone can do is stand & pee. I made sure to head to the pool the next day when it opened at 8am. About 30 patrons had the same idea, but fortunately, they were concerned with confiscating pool chairs for sunbathing. I had the circular Temple Pool all to myself for around 20 mins, in which I swam and waded underneath 1 of the 4 fountains as described earlier. Great way to cool off. Complimentary coffee & tea is offered at the Augustus/Octavius lobby during the hours of 7-9 in the morning. Bonne Maman honey from France is offered in individual mini-jars, of which I have about 10 here at home awaiting for my disposal. Hey, it's free! Don't judge! Across the lobby is a Starbucks in case you don't fancy the free stuff. BTW, Starbucks located in hotels/casinos don't offer free WiFi. Bummer. Express checkout was a breeze. I reviewed my bill on the flat-screen TV, confirmed checkout and left the room keys in the room. I had the time of my life. I felt like a foreign diplomat on my way to meet Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton over cucumber sandwiches to discuss diplomacy. If you have the money to burn, I recommend staying at Caesar's Palace and re-enact your own ""Hangover"". Good times. Excelsior!"  Caesars Palace,12/7/14,Google,Bassam Khaiwi,the perfect place to be when in Vegas  Caesars Palace,12/7/14,Google,Caroline G,Amazing  Caesars Palace,12/7/14,Google,Aex Bvo,"Just one of the classics hotels in Las Vegas, never out of fashion."  Caesars Palace,12/7/14,Foursquare,Juana Hernandez,Impresionante este hotel  Caesars Palace,12/7/14,Expedia,Guest,Really nice spot. Been to Vegas three times this is the best hotel we stayed in yet  Caesars Palace,12/7/14,TripAdvisor,Camp81,"“Come nei film...” Forse uno fra gli hotel più famosi al mondo anche solo per un storico cinematografico, straconsiglio a chiunque voglia andare a Las Vegas.Il prezzo di questi super Hotel è nella media dei nostri 3/4 stelle, ma la qualità è decisamente superiore."  Caesars Palace,12/7/14,Agoda,Matthew C,"Good: Quality of the room, size of the room, location of the hotel."  Caesars Palace,12/7/14,Yelp,Todd W,"The best part about this resort is the location.  It is right in the center of all the action.  Bellagio and Paris to one side and the Mirage and Venetian on the other with the new High Roller obsevation wheel right across the street.  Perfect if you want to be able to walk to all the action.  The staff is friendly, there are great restaurants and the gaming is great.  It would have gotten 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that our room was beat up abit.  There were big scratches on the TV console, a big burn mark on the sofa where someone had set down a hot iron and there were about 30 of those plastic things that that are attached to a shirt that holds a price tag on our carpet.  I know it was not vaccumed when we arrived.  The only reason we didn't move rooms was because we had a great view of the strip and Bellagio fountains.  The rooms are large and well equiped with TV and whirlpool in the bathroom and steam showers.  Mini bar didn't work either, it was hot and when we arrived there was a bottled water missing and of course they charged us for it, even though it was never replaced from the previous people.  I guess it's our fault for not notifying the front desk upon arrival."  Caesars Palace,12/6/14,WeddingWire,Holly,"I just had my wedding here in the Venus Garden. Valerie Thornton was my first contact. She was helpful and got our package set up, but was slightly less responsive once we had our package booked. Then Rebecca Proffitt was our wedding coordinator. She won't really get in touch with you until about 4 weeks or less before your wedding, but she does respond within about 24 hours. The grounds are beautiful, the minister was great, the pianist was great and the photographer was also pretty good. While this place is definitely a wedding mill -- and every single thing adds up, I still would have it here again. The weather was perfect, Rebecca was very sweet, and the place just has a very intimate and romantic feel to it. I had my wedding in December, so I can't speak to loud music at the pool area (which is right behind the garden) because no one was in the pool in December, but that could be an issue if you choose to have your wedding during the warmer seasons. It might also be irritating to walk around the pool area (you have to walk through the pool area to get to the garden) with all the wet puddles on the ground from people splashing around. This, again, wasn't a factor for me because it wasn't pool season during my wedding. I'd highly recommend this place for a wedding in the winter. Still very temperate and beautiful, and we also got a deal with the pricing since it's low wedding season. The only other thing which isn't particuarly great is that the photography packages are very expensive. The photos did come out pretty good though, so that was nice. Overall, would recommend as we had a good experience here."  Caesars Palace,12/6/14,TripAdvisor,Jose V,"“What happened to this place? ” Hello, been here several times at this hotel and even though you see a lot of renovations all the time, the place is becoming more detach from costumers needs. In almost every 5 star hotels and beyond you get essential things like WiFi and other things included in your stay. Also the place looks looks worn out and the prices from coffee to water are beyond reach. I have been all over the world and every time I come here it's getting worse. My only surprise was finding a franchise on my favourite Italian restaurant from New York, carmines. That made my stay worth while. I leave and play in Miami and San Juan. So if you come to Las Vegas don't stay at Cesar Palace, go some where else."  Caesars Palace,12/6/14,TripAdvisor,Dmallyon,"“Overpriced food and dated room” Stayed for business in the Forum Tower. Long hike to the conference centre. My fitbit reported 8+ km more than usual per day. Room was dated, furniture was really beat up. Floor 60 says No Smoking floor when you get off the elevator but all rooms were smoking. No tub, just shower but shower was very very good. Closet light was automatic when door was opened, but kept turning on/off randomly - awesome in the middle of the night. Dirty used tooth pick on the floor next to the chair when I got there -- still there when I left. Meh."  Caesars Palace,12/6/14,TripAdvisor,Aushoneymooners,"“Disappointing customer service for such a beautiful hotel.” Extremely disappointed by the customer service experienced upon arrival of the first night of our Honeymoon after flying for literally half the day arriving late at night. Absolutely no porters or staff in sight upon arrival, 40 minute wait to check in & not even a polite greeting other than ""Credit card & photo ID"". We were given our room card, nil information on where to find anything or about services etc and how dare we ask for assistance from a porter for our bags. Hopefully it can only get better from here!"  Caesars Palace,12/6/14,TripAdvisor,Hormuz85,"“Augustus tower” Came here as a couple for a week. From what we read, Caesars has a number of towers with different quality of rooms in each. We booked a room in Augustus tower thinking it was a good balance between quality and price. Location of this hotel is good, pretty close to the halfway point along the strip.The check-in experience was pretty good. We arrived 2 hours before our check-in time, but the person at the desk said there was a room available right away in the same tower, although it was an ""upgrade"" from what we'd booked. Apparently, ""deluxe"" and ""luxury"" mean different things. Anyway, this person was very kind and gave the room to us without any extra charges.The room we got was amazing. We had a view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. The room was large and clean. The bathroom had a jacuzzi and separate shower. There was a TV in the main room and a TV in the bathroom. The snacks and drinks in the room we decided were too expensive. The mini-fridge in our room had sensors that detected when you removed drinks and automatically charged you for them if you remove them.Internet at the hotel was something like $16 per day per device. It was of acceptable speed, but it had better be for that price. The restaurants downstairs were very good. We went to the Asian noodle place, Serendipity, and Mesa. Otherwise, we ate elsewhere for our meals.Overall, we had a great experience."  Caesars Palace,12/6/14,TripAdvisor,carolmuller,"“Lindo” Além de ser lindo, o hotel possui um shopping dentro, cheio de lojas famosas e restaurantes.Há uma apresentação com agua e fogo a cada meia hora, na fonte localizada em frente à Cheesecake Factory.O estacionamento para visitantes é gratuito e coberto"  Caesars Palace,12/6/14,TripAdvisor,265adelac,"“Great place to visit” I have a wanderful time at Ceasar hotel, Rooms were great, clean and safeHotel host and casino host were very profesional and freindly.The casino has a great variety of gaming so you can have your pick of Slots and table gaming"  Caesars Palace,12/6/14,TripAdvisor,A2100GOwilliamc,“Ok” Really nice place. First time staying there. Nice shops and plenty of great restaraunts. Service was great. Family enjoyed being able to stay in a comfortable room for four people. Only concern is the traffic to get into the casino. Too many cars and people walking across the street.  Caesars Palace,12/6/14,TripAdvisor,Joyce G,"“Excellent” We loved staying at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Upon arrival our room was not ready so they gave us a up grade. We stayed in the palace tower which was wonderful. The room was a good size and also came with a spa bath.The room service was very good our room was always spotless on our return to the room."  Caesars Palace,12/6/14,Yelp,Tristan C,"Review for the sportsbook specifically-6 months ago, this was the best sportsbook on The Strip. Now the TVs are blocked off by a terribly placed bar, and anything resembling comfortable seating is blocked off as Members Only (regardless of the fact that seating was only at half occupancy at most). It's insulting placing hundreds of dollars in bets and being given a shitty conference room chair to sit in. If you want to see a good sportsbook gone terribly wrong, head to Caesars."  Caesars Palace,12/6/14,Yelp,Greg H,One of the best places on the strip. Like coming here even when I don't stay here.,12/6/14,,,
